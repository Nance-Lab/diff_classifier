Cloudknot parallelization
=========================

Diff_classifier also includes example implementations of parallelizing tracking
analysis and visualization with Cloudknot, a package developed by Adam
Richie-Halford.  Some demonstration functions are included in the knotlets
module, but it isn't recommended that you try using these without modification.
See `this notebook <https://github.com/ccurtis7/diff_classifier/blob/master/notebooks/02_16_18_complete_ck_package.ipynb>`_
for an example implementation.
