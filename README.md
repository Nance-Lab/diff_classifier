Diff_classifier is a python package for analyzing and visualizing 2D
nanoparticle trajectory data from multi-particle tracking analysis.  The package
utilizes the ImageJ package Trackmate for tracking analysis, and Cloudknot for
parallelization on AWS.

This is the diff_classifier development site.  You can view the source code and
file new issues. If you are just getting started, you should look at the
[diff_classifier documentation](https://ccurtis7.github.io/diff_classifier/)
