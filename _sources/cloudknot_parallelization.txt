Cloudknot parallelization
=========================

Diff_classifier also includes example implementations of parallelizing tracking
analysis and visualization with Cloudknot, a package developed by Adam
Richie-Halford.  Checkout out the documentation
`here <https://richford.github.io/cloudknot/>`_. Some demonstration functions
are included in the knotlets module, but can easily be built upon for custom
parallelization particle tracking workflows. See
`this notebook <https://github.com/ccurtis7/diff_classifier/blob/master/notebooks/cloudknot_parallelization_demo.ipynb>`_
for an example implementation.
