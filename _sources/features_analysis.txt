Calculating features with diff_classifier
=========================================

The features package in diff_classifier calculates geometric features from the
xy data of each trajectory and assembles them into a pandas dataframe.  The
current features that are calculated include:

* alpha: anomalous diffusion exponent.
* asymmetry (1, 2, 3): various expressions of the manitude of asymmetry of a
  trajectory.
* aspect ratio: the ratio of the long and short side of the minimum bounding
  rectangle.
* elongation: a transform of the aspect ratio, one minus the inverse of the
  aspect ratio.
* boundedness: quantifies how much a particle with diffusion coefficient D is
  restricted by a circular confinement of radius r when it diffuses for time t.
* trappedness: expresses the boundedness in terms of a probability.
* efficiency: relates the squared net displacement to the sum of squared step
  lengths.
* straightness: similar to the efficiency, relates the net displacement to the
  sum of step lengths.
* fractal dimension: 1 for directed trajectories, 2-3 for confined or subdiffusion.
* Gaussianity: 0 for normal diffusion, deviates from 0 for other types.
* kurtosis: see TrajWiki
* mean squared displacement ratio: 0 for Brownian motion, <0 for restricted motion,
  >0 for directed motion.
